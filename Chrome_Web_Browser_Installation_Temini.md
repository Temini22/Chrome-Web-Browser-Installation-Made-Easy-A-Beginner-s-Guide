### Ready to Set Up?
Here's what you'll need:
* A Windows computer with an internet connection.
* A few minutes of your time.

### Let's Get Started!
1. Head over to the Chrome Download Page:
Open your favorite web browser (any browser will work for this) and visit the official Google Chrome download page. You can search for "Download Chrome" online, but be sure you're on the Google website to avoid downloading from untrusted sources. To skip that long process, simply check out the download page [Here](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FHFK&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8J6wBhDXARIsAPo7QA8eMyvUqDT_3LOGqUyI0Gy7-xvDfGdllnaCJwbTKirTyRBIFP0UdbUaAiyOEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) 
2. Download the Chrome Installer:
On the download page, you'll see a big blue button that says "Download Chrome." Click this button to begin downloading the installer file. This file is what will put Chrome on your computer.

3. Run the Downloaded File:
Once the download is complete, find the downloaded file on your computer. It might be in your Downloads folder or wherever your web browser saves downloaded files. The file will usually be named something like **"ChromeSetup.exe"** (for Windows) or **"GoogleChrome.dmg" (for Mac)** since this guide is for Windows users, click look out for **"ChromeSetup.exe"**. Double-click this file to start the installation process.
4. Follow the Installation Wizard:
A window will pop up to guide you through the installation.  These windows are called _wizards_, and they make things nice and easy - like a real wizard would. In the wizard, you might see options to choose an installation location or set Chrome as your default browser.  
**Tip:**  For most users, the default settings are just fine, but feel free to explore if you're curious!  Just click **"Next"** to move through the wizard steps.
5. Almost There!
The wizard will take a few moments to install Chrome on your computer.  You might see a progress bar or message letting you know how things are going.  Just sit back and relax!
6. Once the installation is complete, the wizard might ask if you want to launch Chrome. If so, click **"Finish"** or a similar button and Chrome will open up for you to start browsing!

### System requirements to use Chrome
Chrome makes browsing a surreal experience for everyone due to its safe and secure nature. However, there are certain computer requirements needed to make the running of the Chrome browser on your computer a breeze. 
**These requirements are:**
* To use Chrome on Windows with an Intel processor, you'll need:
Windows 10 and up
* An Intel Pentium 4 processor or later that's SSE3 capable
To use Chrome on Windows with an ARM processor, you'll need:
Windows 11 and up

Before proceeding to install Chrome, check out your system stats in the settings of your computer, or talk to an expert if you’re having trouble finding the information you need. 

Now that Chrome is up and running on your Windows computer, there are some issues you might encounter from time to time. This guide serves to explore those issues and show you how to solve them. 
* **Chrome keeps crashing:** The easiest way to handle this is to try uninstalling the software. Reinstall it after a few minutes to fix problems with your search engine, pop-ups, or Chrome updates.
* **Problems installing Google Chrome:** While installing the software, you might encounter some issues like the download package keeps crashing or the software is simply not installed. This guide will help you fix that. 
* **Error pages keep popping up:** Sometimes, you might experience consistent page crashes and other page loading errors. To fix this, Google has created this handy [guide](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95669) to get you up and running in no time.

### Still can’t install Google Chrome?
This might be because your computer is in > “S mode.” In case you don’t know what this means, and you’ll also like to leave the mode, here’s all that you need to know.

**S mode** is a specific configuration of the Windows operating system designed for security and simplicity. Here's a breakdown of what it offers:
* **Enhanced Security**: S mode restricts users to installing apps only from the official Microsoft Store. This limits the risk of malware or unwanted software sneaking onto your computer, as Microsoft vets all apps in the store.
* **Simplified Interface**: Since only approved apps can be installed, S mode removes some of the complexity of managing your computer. You won't see options for tweaking advanced settings or installing programs from external sources.
* **Performance Benefits**: By limiting software options, S mode can potentially improve system performance and boot times. Fewer programs are running in the background, which can free up resources for other tasks.

#### However, there are also some limitations to consider:
* **Limited Software Selection**: Not all software is available in the Microsoft Store. If you rely on specific programs that aren't offered there, S mode might not be suitable.
* **Restricted Customization**: With S mode, you can't use certain features like command prompt or directly download files from outside the Microsoft Store. This can be limiting for power users who prefer more control over their systems.

#### Who should consider S mode?
* Beginners or those who prioritize security and a streamlined experience.
* Users on school or work computers where IT departments might prefer a more controlled environment.

#### Who might not like S mode?
* Power users who rely on specific software not available in the Microsoft Store.
* Users who prefer extensive customization options for their computers.

#### Is S mode right for you?
Ultimately, it depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you value simplicity and prioritize security for everyday tasks, S mode could be a good option.  However, if you require specific software or more control over your system, the standard version of Windows might be a better fit.

If after going through the breakdown above, you decide S mode isn’t for you, you can learn how to [exit s mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/switching-out-of-s-mode-in-windows-4f56d9be-99ec-6983-119f-031bfb28a307) or proceed to download Chrome on a different computer or even your smartphone.
